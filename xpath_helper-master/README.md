# XPath Helper Improved

This is a fork from the Chrome extension XPath Helper, with some small
modifications in the user interface.

The code for the original extension is available at: https://code.google.com/p/xpaf/

#### Summary of changes:

* Made the box taller a little bit, increased the font sizes and made the colors a bit more bada55. :)
* Changed "move-to-middle" when mouse hovering pressing shift to "move-to-bottom".
* When there are no results to show nothing on the result box instead of `[NULL]`.
